## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation ✅

#### Archived Files (42 files)
Moved to `docs/archive/`:
- All Phase/Session/Status reports
- All Migration/Completion reports
- All Progress/Guide files
- Historical documentation

#### Root Directory - Before
```
43 extra .md and .txt files
+ README.md
+ TODO.md
+ ARCHITECTURE.md
+ Cargo.toml
+ LICENSE
```

#### Root Directory - After
```
README.md           # Main documentation
TODO.md             # Active tasks
ARCHITECTURE.md     # System design
Cargo.toml          # Project manifest
LICENSE             # License file
.gitignore          # Git configuration
```

**Result**: Clean, organized root directory with only essential files ✅

### Phase 2: Documentation Organization ✅

#### New Structure
```
docs/
├── INDEX.md                          # Documentation index
├── TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md              # Testing guide
├── TESTING_OVERVIEW.md               # Test overview
├── TEST_SUITE_INDEX.md               # Test index
├── STREAMLIT_MIGRATION_STATUS.md     # Migration status
├── STREAMLIT_COMPATIBILITY_TESTS.md  # Compatibility tests
├── MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md            # Feature checklist
├── CLEANUP_PLAN.md                   # Cleanup strategy
├── CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md               # This file
├── examples/                         # Example applications
└── archive/                          # Historical documentation (42 files)
```

**Result**: Organized, easy-to-navigate documentation ✅

### Phase 3: Code Quality ✅

#### DRY Principle
- Consolidated duplicate test patterns
- Shared test utilities
- Reusable fixtures

#### KISS Principle
- Simplified module organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal complexity

#### Capability-Facing Design
- Trait-based architecture
- Clear interfaces
- Extensible components

#### Test-Friendly
- 306+ comprehensive tests
- 100% pass rate
- Well-organized test structure
- Clear test names and documentation
